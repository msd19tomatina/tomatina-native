## What it does
The assignment was to program a native android application based on our previous prototypes. <br>
Functionality was not the primary goal, we were asked to implement three screens from our design, with navigation between them. <br>
Our App idea allows the user to track his learn sessions following the pomodoro method. <br>
Every completed learn session earns the user one pomodoro.
To make it more interesting, the user can compare his earned pomodori with other people in a friendly competition. <br>

The artist Vanja Vikalo / LINNCH kindly allowed us to use his art for the icons and background images.

## How to start the app
To test the application you will need to have android studio or a similar IDE installed on your computer. <br>
Download or clone this repository, open the project on your IDE, build the project and start an emulator. <br>
We recommend Android Studio as most things are already implemented there.
